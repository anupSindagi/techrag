Capital expenditures focus on technical infrastructure (servers and network equipment for computing, storage, AI, and data centers) and office fit-outs, with multi-year data center construction. Depreciation on property and equipment totaled $11.9B in 2023 and $15.3B in 2024. Leasing activities include operating and finance leases with substantial future lease payments and not-yet-commenced leases. Financing sources include a short-term debt program up to $10B ($2.3B outstanding as of 12/31/2024), senior unsecured notes carrying value $11.9B with short-term $197M and long-term $3.4B in interest payments, and $10B in revolving credit facilities (no borrowings). Alphabet executed a $62.0B share repurchase in 2024 (379M shares) and in April 2024 authorized up to $70B more with $44.7B remaining. In 2024, dividends were paid totaling $3.5B for Class A, $0.519B for Class B, and $3.3B for Class C. Outstanding EC fines and related payments are disclosed, with a $3.0B cash payment in Q3 2024 for the 2017 shopping fine and fines included in accrued liabilities; income taxes payable were $2.7B and long-term taxes payable were $8.8B as of 12/31/2024. Purchase commitments and other contractual obligations totaled $55.4B, with $32.5B short-term. Alphabet hedges foreign currency risk and uses interest rate derivatives; 10% adverse FX movements could impact income before taxes by about $503M (2023) and $135M (2024). AOCI and CTA effects are discussed under currency hedges. The company notes reliance on contract manufacturers for server assembly.",
