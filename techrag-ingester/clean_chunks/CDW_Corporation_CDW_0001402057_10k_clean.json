Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized. Fair value measurements follow the three‑level hierarchy. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis when the company is the principal (e.g., hardware, many software licenses) and on a net basis when acting as an agent (e.g., certain software assurances, vendor‑partner services).
