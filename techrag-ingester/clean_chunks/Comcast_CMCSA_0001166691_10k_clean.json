    "info": "Media segment revenue rose 11% to $28.1B in 2024, driven by Olympic-related advertising and distribution gains, while linear TV subscriber decline is offset by Peacock growth to 36M paid subscribers. Costs increased, especially programming and production. Studios segment saw modest revenue decline, with content licensing down 2% and theatrical revenue down 19% due to slate timing and prior work stoppages. Theme parks revenue fell 3.7% as attendance slipped, but pre‑opening costs rose for Epic Universe slated for May 2025. Headquarters and other revenue dropped 22%, reflecting lower overhead. The company expects continued subscriber and rating declines in linear TV, higher content and marketing spend at Peacock, and operational impacts from sporting event timing and labor disruptions.",
