Substantial deferred tax assets and liabilities exist, with net deferred tax assets of $9.578 billion as of 2024 and net of valuation allowance $23.537 billion; gross deferred tax assets $27.043 billion and a valuation allowance of $3.506 billion. As of 12/31/2024, state net operating loss carryforwards total $2.36 billion, federal tax credits total $0.595 billion, and state tax credits total $5.47 billion (most do not expire). Unrecognized tax benefits remain significant ($15.131 billion end of 2024), with interest/penalties noted. On the operational side, two segments (FoA and RL) show robust Family of Apps profitability ($69.38B operating income on $164.501B revenue in 2024) while Reality Labs remains loss-making; total company revenue of $164.501B in 2024 with total operating income of $69.38B. Long-lived assets are heavily invested in the United States ($117.478B) and rest of world ($18.79B) for a total of $136.268B as of 12/31/2024. These items imply substantial tax planning considerations and ongoing risk management alongside strong revenue growth in FoA.",
