Foreign‑exchange fluctuations affect international operations and foreign‑currency cash holdings. Rapid global expansion strains management, systems, and controls, increasing risk of operational inefficiencies, fulfillment and data‑center capacity mismatches, and higher costs. System outages, cyber‑security incidents, and data loss could impair services and reputation. Loss of senior‑management or key technical staff, as well as competition for talent, pose staffing risks.
