Deferred revenue increased 1% FY2025, driven by a 2% rise in product deferrals linked to recurring software, while service deferrals were flat. Total contractual obligations reached $47.8 billion, comprising $24.8 billion of long‑term debt, $1.7 billion of operating leases and $7.6 billion of purchase commitments.

    "info": "The company reported no customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue, indicating diversified sales. Long-lived assets were $3.414 billion in FY2025, modestly up from $3.156 billion in FY2024, with U.S. assets comprising the majority. Net income fell to $10.18 billion in FY2025 from $10.32 billion in FY2024, driving basic EPS down to $2.56 from $2.55 and diluted EPS to $2.55 from $2.54, while FY2023 levels were higher. A settlement with a supplier released $563 million of escrow cash and forfeited $450 million of prepayments, incurring a $355 million product‑cost charge offset by an $82 million tax benefit. Executive Vice President Oliver Tuszik adopted a 10b5‑1 trading plan to sell about 49,067 shares through year‑end 2025.",
