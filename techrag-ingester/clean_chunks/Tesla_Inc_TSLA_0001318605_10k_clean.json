Energy revenue costs rose 2.55B (52%) due to Megapack/Powerwall deployments but benefited from IRA credits and a higher‑margin storage mix. R&D rose 571M (+14%) with a higher R&D as a % of revenue (5% in 2024 vs 4% in 2023). SG&A rose 350M (+7%), aided by facilities (+171M), personnel/labor (+115M) and marketing (+57M). In Q2 2024, restructuring actions drove 583M of employee termination expenses. Interest income rose to 1.569B (up 503M, +47%), and Other income (expense), net improved by 523M, led by bitcoin fair value remeasurement and foreign‑currency effects. Provision for income taxes swung to 1.837B in 2024 (vs a 5.001B benefit in 2023), with an effective tax rate of 20% in 2024 versus (50)% in 2023; valuation allowance related to US deferred tax assets was released in 2023 (~6.54B). These items underscore a mix of margin dynamics across segments, aggressive cost initiatives, and tax assets/churn impacting reported profitability.",

The company notes ongoing consideration of deferred tax asset realizability, with exceptions for California assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign losses. Liquidity remains strong with cash and short-term investments totaling about 37.8B, plus $5.0B of unused committed credit. In 2024, debt outstanding was 7.91B (current 2.35B) and lease liabilities were 7.05B (current 1.19B). Management reiterates capex to exceed 11.0B in 2025 and the next two fiscal years. Cash flow highlights for 2024: operating 14.92B, investing (18.79)B, financing 3.85B. Capital expenditures in 2024 were 11.34B with 7.45B of investments purchased; 2023 figures were 8.90B capex and 6.62B investments. FX risk could affect net income by about 1.15B in 2024 and 1.01B in 2023 with 10% adverse moves. Debt issuance proceeds rose by 1.81B in 2024 and debt repayments rose by 1.15B.

Valuation allowance increased by $332M in 2024 due mainly to California assets, U.S. credits and foreign losses; federal/state NOLs total $4.34B and $8.59B respectively; federal RD credits total $1.48B, federal renewable energy credits $1.01B, and state RD credits $1.06B. The company has a $309M unrecognized withholding tax liability tied to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, ongoing IRS/state examinations, and sizable lease commitments (US NY: $5.0B over 10 years; Shanghai: RMB14.08B spend with RMB2.23B annual tax revenue).
