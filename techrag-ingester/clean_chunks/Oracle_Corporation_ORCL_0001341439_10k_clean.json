Restructuring spend dropped to $299 million in 2025 from $404 million in 2024. Interest expense rose modestly to $3,578 million, reflecting $14 billion of senior‑note issuance. Non‑operating income improved to $60 million from a $98 million loss, helped by higher interest income and lower currency and investment losses. Provision for income taxes increased to $1,717 million, raising the effective tax rate to 12.1%. Working capital narrowed to a $8,064 million deficit and cash and marketable securities grew to $11,203 million. Operating cash flow rose to $20,821 million, but investing cash outflow surged to $21,711 million, turning free cash flow negative ($‑394 million). The company paid $4.7 billion in cash dividends, repurchased $2.1 billion of stock, and retained $6.4 billion for future buybacks.
