    "info": "Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease as much as $6 billion in the next 12 months. The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $2.1 billion for 2025 and $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $16.1 billion, $13.8 billion and $13.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $2.1 billion in 2025 and $1.9 billion in both 2024 and 2023. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion, $1.0 billion and $2.1 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had $523 million of fixed payment obligations under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced.",
