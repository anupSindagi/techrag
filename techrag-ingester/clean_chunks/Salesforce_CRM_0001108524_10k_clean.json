Lease obligations total $4.0 billion (with $1.0 billion due in 12 months) and other contractual commitments are $17.3 billion (with $2.8 billion due in 12 months). Restructuring cash outlays are expected between $300 million and $325 million. Cash and marketable securities were $14.0 billion at Jan 31 2025 (down from $14.2 billion in 2024). A 100‑basis‑point rate shift could change market value by $61 million (2025) or $63 million (2024). Debt includes $0 billion credit facility and senior notes ranging from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion across 2028‑2061. Strategic investments span 400 companies with a $4.9 billion portfolio, including $4.74 billion in private equity and $69 million in public equity; the five largest private holdings represent $1.3 billion and a 10% value drop would cut $84 million from the portfolio.",
