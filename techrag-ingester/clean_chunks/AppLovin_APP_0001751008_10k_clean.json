In‑App Purchases and In‑App Advertising showed small gains (1% and 7% respectively) offset by mixed volume and price trends. Cost of revenue rose 10% to $1.17 billion due to higher network infrastructure expenses, partially offset by lower amortization. Sales & marketing, R&D and G&A expenses all increased, with G&A up 19% to $181 million. Interest expense grew to $318 million, and other income improved to $20.8 million. The company highlighted strong installation growth and higher revenue per install but noted reliance on advertising and rising infrastructure costs as material operational factors.",

The tax provision fell sharply in 2024 (‑$27.6 million, 116% lower) due to large stock‑based‑comp and foreign‑income benefits, while it had risen in 2023 (+$36.1 million, 295%).

Operating cash flow improved to $2.10 billion, but the company remains highly leveraged with $3.6 billion of senior debt and a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. The board expanded the stock‑repurchase authorization to $3.3 billion (with $2.3 billion still available). Significant contractual obligations include $1.2 billion of cloud‑service commitments and $184 million of server‑lease payments.
