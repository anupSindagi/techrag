    "info": "Arista disclosed a four‑for‑one stock split effective December 2024 and highlighted continued growth in net income and operating cash flow, with net income rising to $2.85 billion and operating cash generated $3.71 billion in 2024. Deferred revenue more than doubled to $1.29 billion, while inventory write‑downs rose sharply to $267.2 million. The company noted supply‑chain dependence on a few contract manufacturers and component suppliers, and highlighted customer concentration—two resellers accounted for 26% and 24% of accounts receivable and two end‑customers represented 15%‑20% of revenue in 2024. Significant cash movements included strong proceeds from marketable securities maturities, equity issuances, and share repurchases.",
