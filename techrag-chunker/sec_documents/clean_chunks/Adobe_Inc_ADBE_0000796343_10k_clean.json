A valuation allowance of $806 million and unrecognized tax liabilities of $693 million were reported. Cash and equivalents fell to $5.431 billion, with short‑term investments rising to $1.164 billion. Net cash from operations increased to $10.031 billion, but investing and financing activities used $1.187 billion and $11.060 billion respectively, resulting in a $2.182 billion net cash decrease.
