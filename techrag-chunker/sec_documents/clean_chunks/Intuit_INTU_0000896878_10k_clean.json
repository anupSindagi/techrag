Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $4.6 billion, about 9% of which is held by foreign subsidiaries. Contractual obligations as of July 31, 2025 total $14.883 billion, including $248 million of executive deferred compensation, $5.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, $1.014 billion of secured revolving credit facilities, $2.937 billion of interest and fees, $792 million of operating leases and $4.892 billion of purchase obligations, plus $238 million of long‑term tax liabilities. Investment portfolio (cash equivalents and investments) was $3.6 billion generating $175 million of interest income; a 25‑basis‑point rise in the Fed target rate would cut investment value by roughly $1 million, a 100‑basis‑point rise by about $5 million.

The company entered a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in 2024 with no balances outstanding, and $1.0 billion was outstanding on its secured revolving credit facilities. Foreign currency exposure is deemed immaterial and no hedging was performed.",
