Operating cash remained strong at $2.414 billion, while investing activities generated $2.213 billion of cash largely from $12.3 billion of investment maturities and equity sales, offset by $13.9 billion of investment purchases. Financing activities used $3.806 billion, mainly for $3.1 billion of stock repurchases and $750 million debt repayment. The company repaid its 3.450% senior notes ($750 million) and holds $7.0 billion of senior notes outstanding, $1.2 billion due within 12 months, with $2.1 billion of future interest obligations. Commercial paper activity amounted to $180 million short‑term issuance and $450 million long‑term issuance in 2024; $450 million remains outstanding at a 5.10% rate. Liquidity is supported by $7.2 billion of cash, equivalents and investments (excluding $763 million customer funds) and a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.0 billion uplift option. Lease commitments total $544 million ($142 million due within 12 months) and purchase obligations are $86 million ($64 million due within 12 months). Stock repurchase program was expanded by $5.0 billion in 2024, with $3.1 billion repurchased and $3.3 billion remaining. Dividends of $533 million were paid in 2024 and a $0.29 per share dividend was declared for 2025. Ongoing tax examinations remain material, but the company expects at least $170 million of unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced over the next year.",

Restructuring reserve liabilities fell from $102 million at the start of 2024 to $10 million at year‑end after $84 million of payments and $8 million of adjustments; 2023 charges were $141 million with $39 million of payments. Management’s workforce reductions produced $42 million pre‑tax charge in Q1 2023 and $99 million in Q4 2023. Allowance balances for doubtful accounts, authorized credits, transaction losses and tax valuation shifted modestly across 2022‑2024.",
