Management expects cost of revenue and marketing & sales expenses to grow further in FY2026, with R&D spending to rise due to cloud, platform and AI investments, while G&A should stay flat. Interest and other income turned positive in FY2025 after a swing from a loss in FY2023, driven by reduced impairments and gains on securities. Income tax expense increased to $272 million in FY2025 alongside higher pre‑tax income. The company maintains valuation allowances on several jurisdictions, with $312 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of Jan 31 2025.

Fair values of the notes as of Jan 31 2025 were below par (e.g., 2017 notes $487 million vs $500 million principal). Future scheduled principal repayments total $2.3 billion, with large payments due in 2026, 2028 and 2030 and a $1 billion balloon thereafter. Operating lease costs remain material ($66 million in 2025) with cash paid for leases of $93 million and non‑cash lease liability additions of $3 million. Lease liability maturities run from $65 million in 2026 to $27 million in 2030, present value $272 million. Sublease income contributes modest offsets ($8 million in 2025/2024, $5 million in 2023) and future sublease cash flows of $34 million (2026‑2030) and $30 million thereafter. Derivative activity generated small gains/losses and cash‑flow‑hedge notional amounts of $1.52 billion (2025) versus $1.14 billion of non‑hedged contracts.

Pension obligations remain modest with projected benefit obligations around $78m and a $9m liability. A 2026 restructuring will cut ~9% of staff (~1,350 jobs) with pre‑tax charges of $135‑150m. Ongoing legal investigations and a securities class action present uncertain risk, but no material loss estimate is available.",
