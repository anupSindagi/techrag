Foundry revenue fell to $17.5B in 2024, down $1.4B YoY, with intersegment revenue and external revenue also decreasing. Cost of sales rose sharply to $25.6B driven by non‑cash impairments and accelerated depreciation, while operating expenses increased to $5.4B due to higher process‑technology investment, resulting in an operating loss of $13.4B. The All‑Other segment (Altera, Mobileye, etc.) saw revenue decline to $3.8B in 2024, with Altera at $1.5B and Mobileye at $1.7B, reflecting reduced customer inventories.

Litigation costs include a $780 million charge in 2024 and a $401 million EC fine and $353 million termination fee in 2023, offset by $1.2 billion benefits in 2023 and 2022. Asset impairments are sizable: $442 million construction‑in‑progress, $103 million operating‑lease assets, $83 million other lease assets, $3.0 billion goodwill and $108 million intangible impairments in 2024. The tax provision rose sharply to $8.023 billion in 2024 (effective tax rate 71.6%), driven by valuation allowances and impairments, while tax holidays provided $67 million benefit. Deferred tax assets remain large ($10.709 billion R&D, $2.830 billion state credits) but are offset by a $13.974 billion valuation allowance, yielding net deferred tax assets of $‑859 million.",

    "info": "The US Retiree Medical Plan remained in a net‑asset position with projected benefit obligations of $493 M versus assets of $542 M at year‑end 2024, while the 2023 figures were $490 M vs $548 M. The plan follows a 50/50 equity‑fixed‑income target and uses primarily liquid, tax‑aware assets. Worldwide pension and retiree plans were 86% funded; net periodic benefit cost fell to $69 M in 2024 from $107 M in 2023. Several pension plans show unfunded status, with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding assets in some non‑US plans. Discount rates for pension assumptions were modestly lower in 2024 (4.6% vs 4.5% in 2023) and the US pension asset mix targets 91% fixed income/9% equity.",

Estimated benefit payments over the next decade total roughly $1.1 billion, with the largest single‑year outflow of $623 million in 2030‑34. The 2006 equity incentive plan authorizes 1.1 billion shares, with 171 million remaining, and 10 million performance units are outstanding. Share‑based compensation was $3.4 billion in 2024, generating a $684 million tax benefit and a $139 million tax expense. RSU/PSU fair‑value assumptions include a 4.7% risk‑free rate, 1.2% dividend yield and 36% volatility. Stock‑unit balances fell from 172.9 million to 117.4 million in 2024, with 64.5 million granted and 104.3 million expected to vest. The ESPP authorized 523 million shares, with 118 million remaining; employees bought 39 million shares for $972 million in 2024. Operating lease assets stand at $457 million with $248 million lease expense, and finance‑lease assets are $470 million; total lease payments through 2029 amount to $687 million and present‑value $614 million. Capital‑expenditure commitments dropped to $20 billion, other purchase obligations to $7 billion, and an unfunded SCIP contribution of $10.5 billion remains. Legal provisions include a $1 billion VLSI charge, a $401 million EC fine, and a $780 million restructuring charge in Q2 2024. The prior €1.1 billion EC fine from 2009 was overturned in 2022.",
