The divestiture of Careem’s non‑ridesharing business produced a $204 million gain after a $400 million equity contribution and $340 million net consideration. Allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred‑tax asset valuation allowances and insurance reserves all rose across 2022‑2024, indicating higher provisioning. Management also disclosed 10b5‑1 trading plans for up to 350,000 CEO shares and 11,000 CFO shares.",
