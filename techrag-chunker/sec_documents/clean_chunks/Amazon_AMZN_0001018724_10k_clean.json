Based on heavy equipment included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2024, we estimate an increase in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.9 billion, which will be recorded primarily in “Fulfillment” and impact our North America and International segments. We completed our most recent servers and networking equipment useful life study in Q4 2024, and are changing the useful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment, effective January 1, 2025, from six years to five years. For those assets included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2024, whose useful life will change from six years to five years, we anticipate a decrease in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.7 billion. We expect to continue to acquire more of these server and networking assets in 2025. In 2024, we also determined, primarily in the fourth quarter, to retire early certain of our servers and networking equipment. We recorded approximately $920 million of accelerated depreciation and related charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related to these decisions. The accelerated depreciation will continue into 2025 and decrease operating income by approximately $0.6 billion in 2025. These two changes above are due to an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from five years to six years effective January 1, 2024.",

On March 17, 2022, we acquired MGM Holdings Inc., for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired, to provide more digital media content options for customers. We also assumed $2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid immediately after closing. The acquired assets primarily consist of $3.4 billion of video content and $4.9 billion of goodwill. During 2022, we also completed acquisition activity for aggregate cash consideration of $141 million, net of cash acquired. On February 22, 2023, we acquired 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical), for cash consideration of approximately $3.5 billion, net of cash acquired, to provide healthcare options for customers. The acquired assets primarily consist of $1.3 billion of intangible assets and $2.5 billion of goodwill, which is allocated to our North America segment. During 2023, we also completed acquisition activity for immaterial aggregate cash consideration, net of cash acquired. During 2024, we completed acquisition activity for aggregate cash consideration of $780 million, net of cash acquired. The primary reasons for these transactions were to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively or to expand our customer base. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the 2024 transactions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Transaction-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. Goodwill The goodwill resulting from the acquisition activity is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition activity is generally not deductible for tax purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2023 and 2024 by segment (in millions):",

There were $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023, which had an interest rate of 6.6%. As of December 31, 2024, we had $58.0 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”). The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $60.6 billion and $50.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. As of December 31, 2023, we had pledged $806 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”), maturing in January 2024 and bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. The Term Loan was classified as short-term debt and included within “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the entire amount of the Term Loan had been repaid. We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. We have a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), with a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms subject to approval by the lenders. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. In October 2024, we entered into a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which replaced the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into in November 2023. The Short-Term Credit Agreement matures in October 2025 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement or the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $147 million and $151 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.

In April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded Kove 525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove 148 million in pre-judgment interest. In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the CNPD) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the ICA) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of €1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. In October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.

The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to 166 million to 986 million in damages.
