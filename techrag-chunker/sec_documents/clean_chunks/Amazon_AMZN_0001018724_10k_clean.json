Accelerated depreciation recorded in Q4 2024 totaled about $0.92B and will continue into 2025, reducing 2025 operating income by about $0.60B. A prior life-extension for servers from 5 to 6 years effective Jan 1, 2024 generated a 2024 depreciation and amortization reduction of about $3.2B and a net income benefit of about $2.5B ($0.23 per basic and $0.23 per diluted share).

Unearned revenue totaled $24.6B at 12/31/2024 (vs. $20.9B at 12/31/2023), with $14.2B recognized during 2024, and unearned revenue classified in other long-term liabilities was $6.5B in 2024 (vs. $5.7B in 2023). AWS-related commitments not yet recognized were about $177B as of 12/31/2024, and the weighted-average remaining life of long-term contracts is 4.1 years.

    "info": "Debt and liquidity snapshot: as of 12/31/2024 the company had about $58B of unsecured notes outstanding; long‑term debt (net of current portion) around $58.314B, with total face value of long‑term debt at $67.182B (2023) and $58.0B (2024). Amortization for acquired finite‑lived intangibles totaled $604M (2022), $706M (2023) and $838M (2024), with future annual amortization of $0.994B (2025), $0.918B (2026), $0.796B (2027), $0.632B (2028), $0.615B (2029) and $3.484B thereafter, for a total of $7.439B. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are in‑process and used in R&D are indefinite‑lived until completion; amortization begins after completion. The company maintains substantial liquidity and undrawn facilities: CP programs up to $20.0B (including up to €3.0B), a $15.0B unsecured revolver, and a $5.0B short‑term revolver (entered Oct 2024) all largely undrawn as of 12/31/2024; a $8.0B term loan issued in Jan 2023 was repaid by 12/31/2023; no borrowings on CP or revolvers as of 12/31/2023 and 2024. There were $8.3B of unused letters of credit as of 12/31/2024. Weighted‑average remaining life of the Notes was 13.4 years as of 12/31/2024. The company faces significant debt service and commitments across multiple years and categories (long‑term debt, leases, purchase and other commitments) totaling hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate, with LT debt service totaling about $85.539B and total commitments around $333.001B. Material contingencies include a $525M Kove damages award and potential $140–$267M damages (RPI case) plus $148M pre‑judgment interest; no supplier accounts for 10%+ of purchases in 2024.",
